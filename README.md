# Me working out the theory (scattered notes):


Q: What is a 'vibe'?  
A: Conceptually, I think of the vibe as a multi-dimensional 'standing wave'.
'Standing wave' means the wave does not 'propagate' anywhere; it just
 oscillates in-place. E.g. a 1d standing wave would be like
 a string on an instrument; you pluck it, and it vibrates in-place, and you can
 describe the vibration by an amplitude and frequency. If you wanted to describe
 the motion of this 1d vibration in real time, you could use polar co-ordinates,
 where the distance-from-origin would represent the amplitude of the vibration
 (which, in the case of a stringed instrument, decays over time as the
 note fades), and the angle in polar co-ordinates would represent the phase
 of the vibration. In the case of a plucked string, the decaying note would
 (in polar co-ordinates) correspond to the motion of an inward, decaying spiral.

A multidimensional standing wave would be like a trampoline; a jumper jumps
 on it, and the fabric of the trampoline wobbles up and down in response. If
 many people jump on a trampoline at once, the motion of the fabric of the
 trampoline can look quite complicated. However, the trampoline is (hopefully)
 still oscillating in-place, i.e. it has not moved anywhere. 

 
#When reduced to a single dimension, the vibe just looks like an
# oscillation with some defined amplitude and frequency. 


#If you recall the idea of a 'standing wave' from physics class, the image

#Can the vibrations 'propagate through space'?
#Answer: on their own, the vibrations should be thought of as standing waves,
# in that they do not 'propogate' anywhere; rather, they happen in a
# predefined domain, and the motion of the oscillation repeats itself over time.
#Given 

#A vibe is a complex n-dimensional vector; entries indicate the amplitude/phase
# for different 'basis vibrations'


#Q: how do we simulate the 'effort needed to keep something unconscious'?
# A barrier that 'insulates' the vibes that it generates & only communicates
# via a 'feelings' interface?


this question presumes that vibrations 'propagate'; I don't think
# that's the right automatic framing given how we are describing vibrations
# in terms of their basis vibrations. Think of the basis vibration as
# an oscillation. It does not propagate anywhere; rather it happens in
# a pre-defined domain that loops over itself over time.

#The appearance of a vibration 'propagating' occurs when
# *other* possible oscillations get excited in *response* to a previous
# oscillation. So I guess, all that's needed to create the concept of
# a 'propagation' is the concept of temporal causation (i.e. this happened
# before, and in response, this happened after). An arrow of time for events... 
#In ML terms: imagine a RL agent where actions are taken in response to certain
# input conditions (i.e. responses are triggered when certain patterns
# in the collective vibe (as filtered through the agent's perception)
# are recognized by the agent), and the 'actions' create a change in the
# collective vibe. This system is sufficient to simulate a phenomenon that
# we might describe as "a wave propagating through space".


#Maybe the full allowed space of actions is 'any change in the collective vibe
# that satisfies conservation of energy'


'rules' ('reactions') the fact that responses can be triggered in reaction
# to a pattern that is recognized is what is needed to simulate the arrow
# of time, which in turn allows the concept of new vibrations being
# generated in response to old vibrations, which in turn allows us to
# create a simulation of something that we would be tempted to describe as
# '<something> propagating through space'.



#^I don't think that question is a priority to answer, and in either case the real
# question is 'what is the timescale of amplitude decay'; if there is no amplitude
# decay, then the vibration can propagate through the f
