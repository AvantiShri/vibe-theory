# Me working out the theory (scattered notes):

quick note: A vibe is a complex n-dimensional vector; entries indicate the amplitude/phase
 for different 'basis vibrations'

quick note: when projected onto a single dimension, the vibe can be represented
 as a value in polar co-ordinates with some radius (oscillation strength)
 and angle (oscillation phase)

Q: What is a 'vibe'?  
A: Conceptually, I think of the vibe as a multi-dimensional 'standing wave'.
'Standing wave' means the wave does not 'propagate' anywhere; it just
 oscillates in-place. E.g. a 1d standing wave would be like
 a string on an instrument; you pluck it, and it vibrates in-place, and you can
 describe the vibration by an amplitude and frequency. If you wanted to describe
 the motion of this 1d vibration in real time, you could use polar co-ordinates,
 where the distance-from-origin would represent the amplitude of the vibration
 (which, in the case of a stringed instrument, decays over time as the
 note fades), and the angle in polar co-ordinates would represent the phase
 of the vibration. In the case of a plucked string, the decaying note would
 (in polar co-ordinates) correspond to the motion of an inward, decaying spiral.

A multidimensional standing wave would be like a trampoline; a jumper jumps
 on it, and the fabric of the trampoline wobbles up and down in response. If
 many people jump on a trampoline at once, the motion of the fabric of the
 trampoline can look quite complicated. However, the trampoline is (hopefully)
 still oscillating in-place, i.e. it has not moved anywhere. 
 

Q: how do we simulate the 'effort needed to keep something unconscious'?  
Ans: a 'split' in which frequencies can be used; 'unconscious' uses
 a totally different set of frequencies to communicate with self than the
 'conscious' uses to communicate with self, because the unconscious has
 learned to 'hide' its communication frequencies to protect itself from
 'destructive interference' from the 'conscious' mind (conscious mind can't
 stand to hear of certain things and so generates destructive interference
 to hide them). But this segregation of whole communication frequencies
 to the unconscious mind means that (a) those communication frequencies
 can't be used by the conscious mind, and (b) all of the reasoning tools
 that the conscious mind developed can't be directly applied to the
 unconscious mind because they can't access the frequency that the
 unconscious mind communicates on! So the unconscious has to redevelop
 reasoning tools, and it may not do a very good job of them! Maybe this
 is why 'emotions' (which are a communication from the unconscious to the
 conscious mind) tend to 'appear irrational'; they have been generated by
 a very different logic system than the one the conscious mind has access to.

Note that 'different people' can be modeled using pretty much exactly the same type
 of conceptual split needed to separate the conscious from the unconscious.
 You definitely can't hear other people's thoughts because they are using
 a *completely* different set of frequencies than the ones that you
 normally use to think to yourself (assuming you're not
 tuned into psychic frequencies). Have to resort to the (very high-effort i.e.
 high-energy) frequencies of the audio/visual spectrum for communication
 between different people! 

Idea: it would be cool to simulate the process of a negotiation between two
 systems that are doing a lot of internal negotiation on the 'low-effort'
 frequencies and can only communicate with each other on very 'high-effort'
 frequencies (presumably the 'high-effort' is worthwhile because the
 higher frequencies are less susceptible to 'noise contamination'; i.e.
 verbal/visual communication, by virtue of being higher energy, contains
 far fewer errors than would-be psychic communication). 


Q: Can the vibrations 'propagate through space'?
Ans: on their own, the vibrations should be thought of as standing waves,
 in that they do not 'propogate' anywhere; rather, they happen in a
 predefined domain, and the motion of the oscillation repeats itself over time.  
However, within this framework, how can we simulate spatial propagation? Well,
the appearance of a wave 'propagating' occurs can be described as different
types of standing waves becoming 'excited' in response to the existence of
previous standing waves. So I guess, all that's needed to create the concept of
a 'spatial propagation' from the multidimensional vibe is the concept of
an 'arrow of time'.  
In ML terms: imagine a RL agent where actions are taken in response to certain
 input conditions (i.e. responses are triggered when certain patterns
 in the collective vibe (as filtered through the agent's perception)
 are recognized by the agent), and the 'actions' create a change in the
 collective vibe. This system is sufficient to simulate a phenomenon that
 we might describe as "a wave propagating through space".

quick thought:  Maybe the full allowed space of actions is 'any change in the collective vibe
 that satisfies conservation of energy'
