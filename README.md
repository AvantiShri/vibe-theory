## What is a 'vibe'?

A vibe is a multidimensional standing wave oscillation. To represent a vibe, we perform the mutlidimensional equivalent of a fourier series decomposition on the vibe. This decomposition results in a complex-valued vector of some (potentially infinite?) dimension, where each entry in the vector denotes the amplitude and phase for a particular 'basis oscillation' (I'm told this type of decomposition is possible but I don't know the specifics; I know it's linked to s-p-d-f orbitals from quantum chemistry and was used in [Tensor Field Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08219)).

A few things to note:

'Standing wave' means the wave does not 'propagate' anywhere; it just oscillates in-place. E.g. a 1d standing wave would be like a string on an instrument; you pluck it, and it vibrates in-place, and you can describe the vibration by an amplitude and frequency. If you wanted to describe
the motion of this 1d vibration in real time, you could use polar co-ordinates (i.e. complex numbers), where the distance-from-origin would represent the amplitude of the vibration (which, in the case of a stringed instrument, decays over time as the note fades), and the angle in polar co-ordinates would represent the phase of the vibration. In the case of a plucked string, the decaying note would (in polar co-ordinates) correspond to the motion of an inward, decaying spiral.

A 2d standing wave would (I think) be like a trampoline; a jumper jumps on it, and the fabric of the trampoline wobbles up and down in response. If many people jump on a trampoline at once, the motion of the fabric of the trampoline can look quite complicated. However, the trampoline itself is not shifting around in space (or at least, you hope it does not, for the safety of the people jumping on it!).

A 3d standing wave is...well I'm told they look something like the s-p-d-f electron orbitals from quantum chemistry, and that these shapes are in turn connected to Schroedinger's equation, but that's about it all I know...

Anyway, from a modeling perspective, all that matters is that this 'multidimensional equivalent of a fourier series decomposition' is possible, since we can use this to represent the oscillations of reality as a complex-valued vector.
 
## What is the 'physical world' as per vibe theory?  

Let's postulate that the 'full world' is comprised of many vibes all superimposed together. If we were to do an equivalent-of-a-fourier-series decomposition on the 'full world vibe', the 'physical world' would correspond to certain very high frequency components in the vibe.

Reasoning: the physical world is all about boundaries and delineations. We know from signal processing 101 that sharp transitions in a signal correspond to high-frequency components in a fourier series decomposition. It thus stands to reason that a signal approximating the properties of the physical world, with so many sharp edges and complicated boundaries, would be comprised of many high-frequency (and thus high energy) components. This is consistent with the fact that, in physics, it is known that (a) higher frequency oscillations take more energy than lower-frequency oscillations of the same amplitude, and (b) the formula E=mc2 describes how mass is highly concentrated energy, which is compatible with the idea that mass is represented as a high-frequency component in reality's vibe. Finally, there is a third (evolutionary) reason for 'physical' boundaries to correspond to high-energy components; the term of 'physical world' connotes the idea of 'agreed upon by everyone'; signal encoded using high-energy frequencies are less likely to be garbled by accidental noise, and are thus more likely to be 'agreed upon by everyone'; therefore, it stands to reason that what we call our objective reality would correspond mainly to high-energy (i.e. high-frequency) signals.

Note that to get the appearance of causality (e.g. laws of motion), we need not only the arrow of time but also 'reaction rules' governing how the vibe changes as a function of its present state. The causal rules can be thought of as the 'first derivative' of the vibe vector w.r.t. time. We can further constrain all the allowed causal rules to satisfy a 'conservation of energy' rule. That is, for some function mapping a given vibe to a scalar value of energy, the first derivative of this function w.r.t. the arrow of time must be zero. I suspect modern physics has an answer already to the relationship between the frequency of an oscillation and the energy at a given amplitude, which I could just borrow.

So, to sum up: the idea is that in order to get the 'physical world', we take all the vibes and superimpose them to get the collective vibe. In the process of superimposing, some sharp transitions may appear. These sharp transitions, which require very high-frequency oscillations to define, are what we call the 'physical world'.


## How can we understand the difference between the conscious and unconscious mind in terms of vibe theory?

Let us think of a 'conscious self' in vibe theory as a combination of two things:
 1. An 'attention agent' that 'tunes in' to only certain components of the collective vibe vector (these are the components that the attention agent is said to 'experience'), and
 2. A set of 'response rules' that make changes to the collective vibe depending on the 'experience' of the attention agent

The part that we are conscious of is only the 'experience of the attention agent'. We are NOT automatically privy to what all the 'response rules' attached to the experience are, though we can figure them out by noting patterns in the correspondence between 'what we focus attention on' and 'how our experience changes'.

Under this model, an attention agent can 'talk to itself' in the following way:
1. The attention agent concentrates attention on a concept (in vibe theory, a 'concept' could be represented as a particular type of multidimensional oscillation). E.g. it 'thinks about an orange'. This is analogous to asking itself a question (where the question is 'what are your associations to the idea of an orange'?
2. The attention agent observes changes to its experience. For example, they may notice they experience the sensation of hunger. This change can be thought of as the 'answer to the question'.
3. As a result of the answer received, the attention agent can now modify its attention to 'ask the next question'. For example, it could direct attention to the a timekeeping device to effectively ask itself what the time is.

Given this notion of a 'conscious self' as an attention agent, how can we understand the split between the conscious and unconcious mind? Answer: think of them as two separate attention agents that are each largely tuned in to different 'frequencies' (components) in the collective vibe. Indeed, taking inspiration from psychoanalysis, we could say that the id (the 'unconscious mind') has learned to 'hide' its 'communication frequencies' from the ego (the 'conscious mind') to 'protect itself' from meddling, because the ego can't stand to hear the things the id has to say and always tries to silence the id (silencing something can be thought of as generating a 'destructive interference' vibe to cancel it out?). The 'id' only communicates with the 'ego' by generating feelings, and because the 'logic' leading up to the feelings was (intentionally) hidden from the 'ego', the ego can experience the feelings as appearing to 'come out of nowhere' and 'make no sense'. Indeed, segregating away entire experiential frequencies to the id comes with a clear twofold 'cost':
1. Those experiential frequencies aren't being attended to at all by the ego mind, thus limiting not only the experience of the ego but also limiting the complexity of the internal dialogue that the ego could partake in
2. All of the 'reasoning rules' that are attached to the frequencies that the ego typically uses can't be directly applied to the
 id mind, because those rules aren't dialed in to the frequencies that the id relies on for internal communication! Thus, the id has to develop its own reasoning tools to use with its communication channels, and it may not do a very good job of them...but don't blame the 'id' if the ego thinks the emotions are 'irrational'; the 'ego' didn't want to listen to the reasoning in the first place, and that is why the reasoning was hidden.

Note that 'different people' can be modeled using pretty much exactly the same type of conceptual split needed to separate the ego from the id. We can't (normally) hear other people's thoughts because each person typically uses a *completely* different set of frequencies for internal communication. Thus, for communication with others, we typically resort to the very high-energy channels of the 'physical world' (i.e. sound and vision), as these are channels that everyone tends to be tuned into. Also, as before, note that there is value in investing in high-effort communication between entites that are not in constant contact with each other, because when communication is rare it is important that the communication have few errors, and high-energy channels are presumably less prone to communcation errors.


## Scattered notes to self:

Idea: "objective reality" consists only of the magnitudes of each element in the collective vibe; "subjective reality" is the collective vibe 'explained' as a series of oscillations (i.e. both the real and complex components). The 'subjective reality' that "wins" (i.e. that gets to define the evolution of the collective vibe) is randomly sampled from all the subjective realities that fit the data equally well?

quick note: when projected onto a single dimension, the vibe can be represented as a value in polar co-ordinates with some radius (oscillation strength) and angle (oscillation phase)?
