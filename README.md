Scattered thoughts below.

## Q: What is a 'vibe'?

A vibe is a multidimensional standing wave oscillation. To represent a vibe, we perform the mutlidimensional equivalent of a fourier series decomposition on the vibe. Let's say this decomposition results in a complex-valued vector of dimension N, where each entry in the vector denotes the amplitude and phase for a particular 'basis oscillation' in the equivalent-of-a-fourier-series-decomposition (I'm told this is possible but I don't know the specifs; I know it's linked to s-p-d-f orbitals from quantum chemistry and was used in [Tensor Field Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.08219)).

A few things to note:

'Standing wave' means the wave does not 'propagate' anywhere; it just oscillates in-place. E.g. a 1d standing wave would be like a string on an instrument; you pluck it, and it vibrates in-place, and you can describe the vibration by an amplitude and frequency. If you wanted to describe
the motion of this 1d vibration in real time, you could use polar co-ordinates (i.e. complex numbers), where the distance-from-origin would represent the amplitude of the vibration (which, in the case of a stringed instrument, decays over time as the note fades), and the angle in polar co-ordinates would represent the phase of the vibration. In the case of a plucked string, the decaying note would (in polar co-ordinates) correspond to the motion of an inward, decaying spiral.

A 2d standing wave would (I think) be like a trampoline; a jumper jumps on it, and the fabric of the trampoline wobbles up and down in response. If many people jump on a trampoline at once, the motion of the fabric of the trampoline can look quite complicated. However, the trampoline itself is not shifting around in space (or at least, you hope it does not, for the safety of the people jumping on it!).

A 3d standing wave is...well I'm told they look something like the s-p-d-f electron orbitals from quantum chemistry, and that these shapes are in turn connected to Schroedinger's equation, but that's about it all I know...

Anyway, from a modeling perspective, all that matters is that this 'multidimensional equivalent of a fourier series decomposition' is possible, since we can use this to represent the oscillations of reality as a complex-valued vector.
 
## Q: What is the 'physical world' as per vibe theory?  

Let's postulate that the 'full world' is comprised of many vibes all superimposed together. If we were to do an equivalent-of-a-fourier-series decomposition on the 'full world vibe', the 'physical world' would correspond to certain very high frequency components in the vibe.

Reasoning: the physical world is all about boundaries and delineations. We know from signal processing 101 that sharp transitions in a signal correspond to high-frequency components in a fourier series decomposition. It thus stands to reason that a signal approximating the properties of the physical world, with so many sharp edges and complicated boundaries, would be comprised of many high-frequency (and thus high energy) components. This is consistent with the fact that, in physics, it is known that (a) higher frequency oscillations take more energy than lower-frequency oscillations of the same amplitude, and (b) the formula E=mc2 describes how mass is highly concentrated energy, which is compatible with the idea that mass is represented as a high-frequency component in reality's vibe. Finally, there is a third (evolutionary) reason for 'physical' boundaries to correspond to high-energy components; the term of 'physical world' connotes the idea of 'agreed upon by everyone'; signal encoded using high-energy frequencies are less likely to be garbled by accidental noise, and are thus more likely to be 'agreed upon by everyone'; therefore, it stands to reason that what we call our objective reality would correspond mainly to high-energy (i.e. high-frequency) signals.

Note that to get the appearance of causality (e.g. laws of motion), we need not only the arrow of time but also 'reaction rules' governing how the vibe changes as a function of its present state. The causal rules can be thought of as the 'first derivative' of the vibe vector w.r.t. time. We can further constrain all the allowed causal rules to satisfy a 'conservation of energy' rule. That is, for some function mapping a given vibe to a scalar value of energy, the first derivative of this function w.r.t. the arrow of time must be zero. I suspect modern physics has an answer already to the relationship between the frequency of an oscillation and the energy at a given amplitude, which I could just borrow.

So, to sum up: the idea is that in order to get the 'physical world', we take all the vibes and superimpose them to get the collective vibe. In the process of superimposing, some sharp transitions may appear. These sharp transitions, which require very high-frequency oscillations to define, are what we call the 'physical world'.


Q: how do we simulate the 'effort needed to keep something unconscious'?  
Ans: a 'split' in which frequencies can be used; 'unconscious' uses
 a totally different set of frequencies to communicate with self than the
 'conscious' uses to communicate with self, because the unconscious has
 learned to 'hide' its communication frequencies to protect itself from
 'destructive interference' from the 'conscious' mind (conscious mind can't
 stand to hear of certain things and so generates destructive interference
 to hide them). But this segregation of whole communication frequencies
 to the unconscious mind means that (a) those communication frequencies
 can't be used by the conscious mind, and (b) all of the reasoning tools
 that the conscious mind developed can't be directly applied to the
 unconscious mind because they can't access the frequency that the
 unconscious mind communicates on! So the unconscious has to redevelop
 reasoning tools, and it may not do a very good job of them! Maybe this
 is why 'emotions' (which are a communication from the unconscious to the
 conscious mind) tend to 'appear irrational'; they have been generated by
 a very different logic system than the one the conscious mind has access to.

Note that 'different people' can be modeled using pretty much exactly the same type
 of conceptual split needed to separate the conscious from the unconscious.
 You definitely can't hear other people's thoughts because they are using
 a *completely* different set of frequencies than the ones that you
 normally use to think to yourself (assuming you're not
 tuned into psychic frequencies). Have to resort to the (very high-effort i.e.
 high-energy) frequencies of the audio/visual spectrum for communication
 between different people! 

Idea: it would be cool to simulate the process of a negotiation between two
 systems that are doing a lot of internal negotiation on the 'low-effort'
 frequencies and can only communicate with each other on very 'high-effort'
 frequencies (presumably the 'high-effort' is worthwhile because the
 higher frequencies are less susceptible to 'noise contamination'; i.e.
 verbal/visual communication, by virtue of being higher energy, contains
 far fewer errors than would-be psychic communication). 




## Subjective vs. objective reality




## Scattered notes to self:


quick note: when projected onto a single dimension, the vibe can be represented
 as a value in polar co-ordinates with some radius (oscillation strength)
 and angle (oscillation phase)
